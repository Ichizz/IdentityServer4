"To use the end session endpoint a client application will redirect the "
"user's browser to the end session URL. All applications that the user "
"has logged into via the browser during the user's session can "
"participate in the sign-out."

"When the user is redirected to the endpoint, they will be prompted if "
"they really want to sign-out. This prompt can be bypassed by a client "
"sending the original *id_token* received from authentication. This is "
"passed as a query string parameter called ``id_token_hint``."

"If a valid ``id_token_hint`` is passed, then the client may also send a "
"``post_logout_redirect_uri`` parameter. This can be used to allow the "
"user to redirect back to the client after sign-out. The value must match "
"one of the client's pre-configured `PostLogoutRedirectUris` (:ref:"
"`client docs <refClient>`)."

"If a valid ``post_logout_redirect_uri`` is passed, then the client may "
"also send a ``state`` parameter. This will be returned back to the "
"client as a query string parameter after the user redirects back to the "
"client. This is typically used by clients to round-trip state across the "
"redirect."
