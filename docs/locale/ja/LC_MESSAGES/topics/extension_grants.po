"You might have heard of the term *poor man's delegation* where the access"

"some shortcomings, e.g. *API 2* must now accept the *API 1* scope which "
"would allow the user to call *API 2* directly. Also - you might want to "
"add some delegation specific claims into the token, e.g. the fact that "
"the call path is via *API 1*."
