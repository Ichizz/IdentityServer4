"You can define resources using a C# object model - or load them from a "

"Identity resources are data like user ID, name, or email address of a "
"user. An identity resource has a unique name, and you can assign "
"arbitrary claim types to it. These claims will then be included in the "
"identity token for the user. The client will use the ``scope`` parameter "
"to request access to an identity resource."

"The OpenID Connect specification specifies a couple of `standard "
"<https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ScopeClaims>`_ "

"``openid``::"
