"The signin scheme specifies the name of the cookie handler that will "

"with the external authentication process."

"Given that this is such a common practise, IdentityServer registers a "

"When redirecting to an external provider for sign-in, frequently state "
"from the client application must be round-tripped. This means that state "
"is captured prior to leaving the client and preserved until the user has "
"returned to the client application. Many protocols, including OpenID "
"Connect, allow passing some sort of state as a parameter as part of the "
"request, and the identity provider will return that state on the "
"response. The OpenID Connect authentication handler provided by ASP.NET "
"Core utilizes this feature of the protocol, and that is how it implements"
" the ``returnUrl`` feature mentioned above."

"The problem with storing state in a request parameter is that the request"
" URL can get too large (over the common limit of 2000 characters). The "
"OpenID Connect authentication handler does provide an extensibility point"
" to store the state in your server, rather than in the request URL. You "
"can implement this yourself by implementing "
"``ISecureDataFormat<AuthenticationProperties>`` and configuring it on the"

"the ``AddOidcStateDataFormatterCache`` extension method on the "
