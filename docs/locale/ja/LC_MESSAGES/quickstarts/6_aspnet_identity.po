"IdentityServer is designed for flexibility and part of that is allowing "
"you to use any database you want for your users and their data (including"
" passwords). If you are starting with a new user database, then ASP.NET "
"Identity is one option you could choose. This quickstart shows how to use"
" ASP.NET Identity with IdentityServer."

"This quickstart assumes you've been through all of the prior quickstarts."
" The approach this quickstart takes to using ASP.NET Identity is to "
"create a new project from the ASP.NET Identity template in Visual Studio."
" This new project will replace the prior IdentityServer project we built "
"up from scratch in the previous quickstarts. All the other projects in "
"this solution (for the clients and the API) will remain the same."

"The first step is to add a new project for ASP.NET Identity to your "
"solution. Given that a lot of code is required for ASP.NET Identity, it "
"makes sense to use the template from Visual Studio. You will eventually "
"delete the old project for IdentityServer (assuming you were following "
"the other quickstarts), but there are several items that you will need to"
" migrate over (or rewrite from scratch as described in the prior "
"quickstarts)."
